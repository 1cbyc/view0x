# This file is intentionally empty.
# Cloudflare Pages detects yarn.lock at the root and tries to use yarn workspaces.
# This empty file tells yarn that frontend is a separate project, not part of the workspace.
# The frontend actually uses npm (package-lock.json), but this prevents workspace errors.
